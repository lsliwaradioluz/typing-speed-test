# Typing Speed Test
How fast are you? 

# How it works? Is it fun?  
Of course it is fun! Check your typing skills now and see how you did compared to others! This typing speed test app was inspired by LiveChat. The design might look familiar but it was written from scratch using Vue. 

In the middle of the screen you will see a row of random words. 
  * type words in order of their appearance (from left to right)
  * after typing each word, you have to confirm it by pressing space
  * after pressing space, you will no longer be able to edit the word you've just typed (in case of mistakes)
  * if you confirm a word with a typo, your accuracy score will drop 
  * the time is 60 seconds
  * the score will be number of words, letters per minute as well as your accuracy
  * you can save your score. Who knows, maybe you'll make it to the leadership boad :)
